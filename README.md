The template is based on the idea of https://github.com/S-ecki/AdventOfCode-Starter-Dart. This year I will pace myself a bit and do it, when I have time. So probably only on the weekends. I am not reaching for the leaderboard.

## Diary

### Day 01

It was the expected easy start, but I had to get a bit going on Dart again. Did it with a for loop initially and then moved on towards a folding into a Columns type.

### Day 02

Solution was not that hard and it works on my examples, but the edge cases are not working. Might fix it later.

### Day 03

I had some problems with the regex handling in Dart, but it was an easy exercise.
