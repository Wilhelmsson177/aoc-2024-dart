# Advent of Code 2023 using Dart 3.2

Initially I had in mind to go with Rust, but I does not feel like my language yet. Therefore I go with Dart again as I did 2022.

The template is based on the idea of https://github.com/S-ecki/AdventOfCode-Starter-Dart.

## Diary

### Day 01

PartA was pretty simple to solve with a RegEx. For the second part I used the `matchAny` function of the `quiver` library, which allows to match against a list of patters. It was quite some typing to get all the patterns covered. I had some copy past error where I tried to parse the int from a number as a word. I forgot to change matchLast to matchFirst after copy. Let's see what tomorrow brings. Maybe I will take some time to clean up.

### Day 02

Today I tried out the dartx package to parse into integers and I used a lot of splitting on the specific delimiters. I also created and enum for the colors and s simple `ColorCounts` class to hold the values. The List comprehension in the end was done using `.map` on the List of `ColorCounts`. In Python it feels a bit better and the types did not allow me to have it all in one line. A special thanks goes to the `trim()` method today.

### Day 03

Today was fun. My initial idea was to go with the Symbols and check the neighbours their, but I found it pretty hard to get the correct numbers. So I started to get the numbers first and checked the neighbours of the first and the end position of the number. I was able to reuse the `Field` in the template repository to get the neighbours.
I also had the idea of extracting the symbols from the input instead of writing a list of all possible symbols, I was sure that I would have missed one of the symbols.

### Day 04

Today was straight forward. I had some trouble with spaces in my splits, but that was fixed easily. I hopefully finally remember the `fold` for getting a sum of the values of a list.

### Day 05

This was brute-force 10 Minutes on my machine. I probably come back to this one, when there is time.

### Day 06

Also brute force in the first, but then I used the `equations` package and the time went from som 300 ms to about 1 ms. This was nice.

### Day 07

That was some headache. My compareTo function wasn't working in the beginning for Part 2, because I did not check on the source hand, but on the hand with my replaced values.

### Day 08

That was a cool riddle. Part 1 was straight forward. Part 2 could not be solved simulating, but with the LCM for all cycles found for each start.

### Day 09

Today was rather easy, but I had some issues with negative values in my predictions.

### Day 10

The first part was okay, but I forgot a few things. Like "S" as a possible connected pipe. The Part 2 was solved by shoelace and pick's theory. Thank you AoC community for this hint.

### Day 11

Cool riddle today. It was actaully straight forward, but it was a bit of typing and I made some errors in the initial expansion. For part to I got a headeache because of `extensionFactor - 1`. But now it solves. I hope no one tried brute-forcing it.

### Day 15

This was easy doing today. You just need to read carefully. I forgot to read the fact, that the relevant box is just on the label and not the entire instruction. Also the 0 index based list calucaltion for the focal power was missing a `+1`, multiplication by 0 does not bring up high values :-D. 


### Day 16

Nice implementation with enums and a Lavamap. It was incredible slow in the beginning because of the time consuming logging, which I had enabled for debugging. Even tough the log level was higher it calculated the string for the output before not even loogging it. It took about 22 minutes to run, after I removed it it was just 28 ms. I thought I made a huge mistake. In the end it was nice.


### Day 17

Not yet done. No time, yet

### Day 18

On the bicycle ride home from the christmas market it cam to my mind, that the same problem was already solved on Day 10. Shoelace + the border Points combined with pick's theorem solved it. It is not fast. 18 seconds on Part B. But it is correct. I already have some optimization in mind. Let's see if I can find the time.
